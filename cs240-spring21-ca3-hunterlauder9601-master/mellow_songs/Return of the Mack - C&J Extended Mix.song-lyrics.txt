Oooooh, come on, ooh yeah

Well I tried to tell you so (yes I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I know it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'm with

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes, I tried
You lied to me
Even though you know I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes, I cried

Return of the mack
It is
Return of the mack
Come on
Return of the mack
Oh, my god
You know that I'll be back
Here I am

Return of the mack
Once again
Return of the mack
Top of the world
Return of the mack
Watch my flow
You know that I'll be back
Here I go

So, I'm back up in the game
(Running things like my swing)
Lettin' all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause what they didn't know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

You lied to me
Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do do do

Return of the mack
It is
Return of the mack
Come on
Return of the mack
Oh my God
You know that I'll be back
Here I am
Return of the mack
Once again
Return of the mack
Top of the world
Return of the mack
Watch my flow
You know that I'll be back(don't you know)

Return of the mack
It is
Return of the mack
Hold on
Return of the mack
Be strong
You know that I'll be back
Here I come
Return of the mack
My little girl
Return of the mack
Watch my flow
Return of the mack
Up and down
You know that I'll be back (round and round)

Return of the mack
Yes it is
Return of the mack
Yes it is
Return of the mack
Yes it is
You know that I'll be back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Return of the mack
Yes it is
Return of the mack
Yes it is
Return of the mack
Yes it is
You know that I'll be back(aaauw)
