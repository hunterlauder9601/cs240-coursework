Worry the bottle Mamma, it's grapefruit wine
Kick off your high heel sneakers, it's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as they play 'til dawn
Nothin' but blues and Elvis
And somebody else's favorite song

Give her some funked up muzak, she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right

No static at all (no static, no static at all)
FM (no static at all)

Give her some funked up muzak, she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
