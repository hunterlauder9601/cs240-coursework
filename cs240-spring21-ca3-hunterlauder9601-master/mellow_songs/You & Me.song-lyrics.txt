Wanna pack your bags, something small
Take what you need and we disappear
Without a trace we'll be gone, gone
The moon and the stars, they will follow the car
And then when we get to the ocean
We're gonna take a boat to the end of the world
All the way to the end of the world

Oh, and when the kids are old enough
We're gon' teach them to fly

You and me together could do anything, baby
You and me together, yes, yes
You and me together we could do anything, baby
You and me together, yes, yes

You and I, we're not tied to the ground
Not falling but rising like rolling around
Eyes closed above the rooftops
Eyes closed, we're gonna spin through the stars
Our arms wide as the sky

We're gon' ride the blue all the way to the end of the world
To the end of the world
Oh, and when the kids are old enough
We're gon' teach them to fly

You and me together we could do anything, baby
You and me together, yes, yes
You and me together, we could anything, baby
You and me together, yes, yes

We can always look back at what we did
Always remembering you and me, baby
But right now it's you and me forever, girl
And you know we could do better than anything that we did
You know that you and me, we could do anything

You and me together, we could do anything, baby
You and me together, yes, yes
Two of us together, we could do anything, baby
You and me together, yeah, yeah

Two of us together, yeah, yeah
Two of us together, we could do anything, baby
Pack something small, 'til we reach the end of the world
