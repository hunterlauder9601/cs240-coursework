Come and see
I swear by now
I'm playing time against my troubles, oh
Oh, I'm coming slow but speeding
Do you wish for a dance?
And while I'm in the front
Our play on time is won
Oh, but the difficulty's coming here
Instrumental

I will go in this way
Oh and I'll find my own way out
I won't tell you what to be
Oh no but I'm coming to much more

Me
All at once the ghosts come back
Reeling in you now
Oh, what if they came down crushing?
It used to be that you and me played for all the loneliness
That nobody notices now, oh, begging slow
I'm coming here, yeah yeah
Instrumental

Only waiting
I wanted to stay
I wanted to play
I wanted to love you
I'm only this far
And only tomorrow leads the way
I'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head

Please
I wouldn't pass this by
Ohbut I wouldn't take any more than
What sort of man goes by?
But I will bring water
Why won't you ever be glad?
It melts into wonder and
I came in praying for you
Why won't you run into rain and play
Let tears splash all over you?
Instrumental
