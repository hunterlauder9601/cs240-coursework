Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never, never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
I like the way you make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa (whoa), you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa (whoa), you've got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

Oh (duruduru), yeah (duruduru)
My love, my love
Oh (duruduru, duruduru)
Oh, yeah
My love, my love (wooh)
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Oh, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love

Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
The way I feel about ya√¨ou, baby
Can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see

Oh, but in my heart
You're all I need
You for me and me for you
Oh, it's growin' every day (my love, my love)
Oh (duruduru, duruduru), oh

Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh
You've got the best of my love
Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh
You've got the best of my love
Oh, givin' you the best of my love
My love
Oh, my love
Oh, givin' you the best of my love
My love, oh yeah
Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh
You've got the best of my love (you got the best, you got the best)
Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh (oh, my love)
You've got the best of my love
Oh, givin' you the best of my love
Oh, givin' you the best of my love
