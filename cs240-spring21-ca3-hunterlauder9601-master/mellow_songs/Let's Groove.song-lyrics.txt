Let this groove, get you to move,
It's alright, alright
Let this groove, set in your shoes,
Stand up, alright

Gonna tell you what you can do,
With my love, alright
Let you know girl you're looking good
You're out of sight and alright

Move yourself and glide like a 747
Loose yourself in the sky among the clouds in the heavens

Let this groove, light up your fuse, alright
Let this groove, set in your shoes

Stand up, alright
Let me tell you what you can do
With my love, alright

Gotta let you know girl you're looking good
You're out of sight, you're alright

Tell the DJ to play your favorite tune
Then you know it's okay
What you found is happiness, now

Let this groove, get you to move, alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
Stand up, alright

You will find peace of mind on the floor
Take a little time, come and see, you and me
Make a little sign, I'll be there after a while
If you want my love

We can boogie on down, down, down, down
Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight
