Hey, girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world (world)
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away

I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, babe (babe)
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong (uh)

Don't want to think about it (uh)
Don't want to talk about it (uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
But tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should have known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah

Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is

I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby (baby)
And now it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong, yeah

Don't want to think about it (no)
Don't want to talk about it (huh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya can you tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Uh)
Should have known better when you came around
Should have known better that you were gonna make me cry
And now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's ok, baby, 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah

What goes around comes around (comes around, comes around)
Yeah
What goes around comes around (comes around, comes around)
You should know that

What goes around comes around (comes around, comes around)

Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Ah, tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Oh)
Should have known better when you came around
Should have known better that you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around ('cause I know that you're living
a lie)
But that's ok, baby, 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah (yeah babe)

Let me paint this picture for you, baby (yo, yo) (uh)

You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him all you get is a busy tone

I heard you found out
That he's doing to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case scenario
Tale as old as time girl, you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody to cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody that could come and make it right

But girl, I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
See, see (uh)

I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)

I thought I told ya, hey (hey)
(Ha, what goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey (hey)

Take it to him
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Take it to him
See (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
You should have listened to me, baby
Take it to him
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey) Take it to him
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Uh
Hey girl
Because what goes around comes back around
Ooh
