I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

Everytime you're near
Everytime I see you smile
Hear your "hello"
Saying you can only stay a while

And I know that it's hard for you
To say the things that we both know are true
But tell me how come

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin', babe

Every time I hear
How you never want to live a lie
How it's gone too far
And you don't have to tell me why

Why you're gone and why the game is through
If this is what's real, if this is what's true
Tell me how come

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore (baby)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear (yeah, yeah)
I keep forgettin'

Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine anymore, anyway, anytime
Tell me how come

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore (how come I)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin' (baby)

Every time you're near (I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore)
Every time you're near (I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again)
Oh baby (I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear)
Every time you're near (I keep forgettin')
