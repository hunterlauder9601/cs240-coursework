You were the girl that changed my world
You were the girl for me
You lit the fuse, I stand accused
You were the first for me

But you turned me out baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

But you turned me on baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

You were my thrills, you were my pills
You dropped a bomb on me

You turn me out, you turn me on
You turned me loose then you turned me wrong

You dropped a bomb on me
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

But you turned me out baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

Just like Adam and Eve
Said you'd set me free
You took me to the sky, I'd never been so high

You were my pills, you were my thrills
You were my hope baby, you were my smoke

You dropped a bomb on me, hey baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

But you turned me out, baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

But you turned me on, baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

You dropped a bomb on me, baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

We were in motion, felt like lotion
You were the girl for me
You were the first explosion turned out to be corrosion
You were the first for me

But you turned me out, baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me (whoa, oh, oh, baby)
You dropped a bomb on me
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

I won't forget what you done to me, baby (you dropped a bomb on me)
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

You dropped a bomb on me
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

I, I-I, I-I-I won't forget it
I, I-I, I-I-I won't forget it

You dropped a bomb on me
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

You dropped a bomb on me
Baby, you dropped a bomb on me

I, I-I, I-I-I won't forget it
I, I-I, I-I-I won't forget it

You turned me out, you turned me on
And then you dropped me to the ground
You dropped a bomb on me

You turned me out, you turned me on
And then you dropped me to the ground
You dropped a bomb on me

You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turned me out, then you turned me on (I, I-I)
You dropped a bomb on me (I-I-I won't forget it)
You turned me out, then you turned me on (I, I-I)
You dropped a bomb on me (I-I-I won't forget it)
You turned me out, then you turned me on (baby, you dropped a bomb on me, babe)
You dropped a bomb on me (then you turned me on)
You turned me out, then you turned me on (turned me on, babe)
You dropped a bomb on me (then you turned me on, babe)
You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me (then you turned me on, babe)
You turned me out, then you turned me on, baby
You dropped a bomb on me
