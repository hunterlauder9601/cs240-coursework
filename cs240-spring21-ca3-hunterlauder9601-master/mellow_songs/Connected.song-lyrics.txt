Ah ah
Something ain't right
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light which is reflected
I see through you, I see through you
I see through you, I see through you
Your dirty tricks, you make me sick
I see through you, I see through you
I'm gonna do it again, I'm gonna do it again
Ah ah, you gotta do right
'Cause something ain't right
You gotta do right, come on
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Ah ah
Ain't gonna go blind
I see through you, I see through you
I see through you, I see through you
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light that is reflected
Hear me out
Can you hear me out
Can you hear me out
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
You terrified
Ain't gonna go blind
Ain't gonna go blind
Here we go
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Hear me out
Stumble you might fall
Interstate 5, stayin' alive
Won't someone try, open up your eyes
You must be blind if you can't see
The gaping hole called reality
Wanna do it again
I gonna gonna do it again
I wanna do it again
Come on, I'm gonna do it again
Hear me out, terrified
Somethin' ain't right
Here we go
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
