 [All]
525,600 minutes
525,600 moments so dear
525,600 how do you measure measure a year?

In daylights in sunsets
In midnights in cups of coffee
In inches in miles
In laughter and strife
In 525,600 minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?

How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/rosario-dawson/-/seasons-of-love.html]

525,600 journeys to plan
525,600 how do you measure the life of a woman or a man

[Collins]
In truth that she learned
Or in times that she cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died

[All]
It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate remember a year in the life of friends

Remember the love (Oh you've got to, you've got to remember the love)
Remember the love (You know that love is a gift from up above)
Remember the love (Share love, give love, spread love)
Measure in love (Measure, measure your life in love)
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Measure your life, measure life in love
