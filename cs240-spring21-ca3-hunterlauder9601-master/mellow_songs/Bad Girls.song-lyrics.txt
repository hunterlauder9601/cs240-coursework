Baby please, please don't take your love from me
I am yours forever more, 'till eternity
Silently, listen to the words I say
I'm not talking just for play, listen to me please

Heaven knows it's not the way it should be and
Heaven knows it's not the way it could be and
Don't you know there's no need to leave

Heaven knows I never wanna leave you
Heaven knows I only wanna please you
Don't you know love is what I need

Down inside, don't get caught with foolish pride
Put all the other things aside, there's only you and me
Believe in us, we were always meant to be
Me for you and you for me, 'till eternity

Heaven knows it's not the way it should be and
Heaven knows it's not the way it could be and
Don't you know there's no need to leave

Heaven knows I only wanna love you
Heaven knows I never wanna lose you
Don't you know love is meant to be

Heaven knows it's not the way it should be
Heaven knows stop with the pretending
Come on now, hear me when I cry
