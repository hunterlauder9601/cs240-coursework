See, I'm leaving
This warehouse frightens me
Has me tied up in knots
Can't rest for a moment
Soon I'm going

I'm slippin' slow away
Hoping to find something better than
I've got inside of here
And the warehouse slips away

Hey, reckless mind
Don't throw away your playful beginnings
You and I will fumble around
In the touches and be sure to

Leave all the lights on
So we can see the black cat changing colours
And we can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide turns you around and around

Hey, we have found
Becoming one in a million
Slip into the crowd
This question I found in a gap in the sidewalk

Keep all your sights on, hey
The black cat changing colours
And you can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide choose to turn you 'round

But I say life goes on
End of tunnel, T.V. set
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistical bit
Soon, I'll fade away, I'll fade away

But this I admit
Tastes so good, hard to believe an end to it
Smell, touch, feel
How could this rhythm ever quit?
Bags packed on a plane
Hopefully to Heaven, yeah

Shut up, I'm thinking
I had a clue, now it's gone forever
Sitting over these bones
You can read in whatever you're needing to

Keep all your sights on
Yeah, man, the black cat changing colours
When it's not the colours that matter
But that they'll all fade away, yeah, yeah, yeah

Life, life goes on
End of tunnel, T.V. set
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistical bit
Soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away

This I admit seems so good
Hard to believe an end to it
Warehouse is bare
Nothing at all inside of it
The walls and halls have disappeared
They've disappeared, yeah

Oh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Oh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Oh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Oh, I'd love to stay, yeah

In a corner was wondering
If a change could be better than this
Oh, and then I worry
Maybe things won't be better than they have been

Here in the warehouse
In the warehouse
In the warehouse
Oh, how I'd love to stay here
At the warehouse
Every man and woman, get alive

That's our blood down there
Seems poured from the hands of angels
But trickle into the ground
Leaves the warehouse bare and empty

And my heart's numbered beat
Still echo in this empty room
And fear wells in me
But nothing seems enough to defend
So I am going away, I am going away
I'm not giving in
