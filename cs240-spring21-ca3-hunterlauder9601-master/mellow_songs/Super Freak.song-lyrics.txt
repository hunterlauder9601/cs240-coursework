She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street

She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all time fav'rite
When I make my move to her room
It's the right time, she's never hard to please

That girl is pretty wild now
The girl's a super freak
The kind of girl you read about
In the new wave magazines
That girl is pretty kinky
The girl's a super freak
I'd really like to taste her
Every time we meet
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me yeah
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky, super freak, super freak

She's a very special girl
From her head down to her toenails
Yet she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine

Three's not a crowd to her, she said
Room 714, I'll be waiting
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

That girl is pretty wild now
The girl's a super freak
The kind of girl you read about
In the new wave magazines
That girl is pretty kinky
The girl's a super freak
I'd really like to taste her
Every time we meet
She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me yeah
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky, super freak, super freak
Temptations sing, oh, super freak
Super freak, the girl's a super freak; oh

She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street
