Baby, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you, maybe I'm amazed
At the way you pulled me out of time, you hung me on the line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Baby I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle
Of something that he doesn't really understand, maybe I'm a man
Maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me
Baby won't you help me to understand? Ooh ah

Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle
Of something that he doesn't really understand, baby I'm a man
And maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me
Baby won't you help me to understand? Ooh ah

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way leave you, maybe I'm amazed
At the way you help me sing my song, you right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Won't you help me to understand? Ooh ah

Maybe I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle
Of something that he doesn't really understand, baby I'm a man
You're the only woman who could ever help me
Won't you help me to understand? Ooh

Oh maybe I'm amazed, maybe I'm amazed
Yeah, maybe I'm amazed, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, maybe I'm amazed, I'm amazed with you, ooh ooh
