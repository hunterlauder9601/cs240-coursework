Way back when in '67
I was the dandy gamma chi
Sweet things from Boston so young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?
Hey nineteen
(No we can't dance together) We can't dance together
(No we can't talk at all)
Please take me along when you slide on down
Hey nineteen
That's 'Retha Franklin
She don't remember Queen of Soul
It's hard times befallen soul survivors
She thinks I'm crazy but I'm just growing old
Hey nineteen
(No we got nothing in common) We can't dance together
(No we can't talk at all)
Please take me along when you slide on down
Nice
Sure looks good
Umm-umm-umm
Skate a little lower now
(The cuervo gold)
(The fine colombian)
(Make tonight a wonderful thing)
Say it again
(The cuervo gold)
(The fine colombian)
(Make tonight a wonderful thing)
(The cuervo gold)
(The fine colombian)
(Make tonight a wonderful thing)
(No we can't dance together)
(No we can't talk at all)
