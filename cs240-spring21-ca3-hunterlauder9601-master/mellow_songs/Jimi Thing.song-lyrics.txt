Lately I've been feeling low
A remedy is what I'm seeking
I take a taste of what's below
Come away to something better

What I want is what I've not got
But what I need is all around me
Reaching, searching, never stop
And I'll say

If you could keep me floating just for a while
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel called Jimi
If you could keep me floating just for a while
I'll get back to you

Sometimes a Jimi Thing slides my way and keeps me swingin'
I'd like to show you what's inside
But I sure don't care if you do or don't like it
Brother chaos rule all about
Well, sometimes I walk there
Yes, God knows, sometimes I take a bus there
Shouldn't care, I shouldn't care, bereaved as I'm feeling

You know, the day is gone, I'm on my back
Staring up at the ceiling
I take a drink, sit back, relax
Smoke my mind to make me feel
Better for a small time

What I want is what I've not got
And what I need is all around me
Reaching, searching, never stop
And I'll say

If you could keep me floating just for a while
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel called mommy
If you could keep me floating just for a while
I'll get back to you

Sometimes this Jimi Thing slides my way and keeps me swingin'
I'd like to show you what's inside
But I sure don't care if you do or don't like it
Brother chaos rule all about
Sometimes I walk there
Yes, God knows, sometimes I take a bus there
Shouldn't care, I shouldn't care, bereaved as I'm feeling

Lately I've been feeling low
A remedy is what I'm looking for
So I take a taste of what's below
Come away

If you could keep me floating just for a while
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel called Jimi
If you could keep me floating just for a while
Well I'll get back to you

Sometimes this Jimi Thing slide my way and keep me swingin'
I'd like to show you what's inside
But I sure don't care if you do or don't like it
Brother chaos rule all about
Well, sometimes I walk there
Yes, God knows, sometimes I take a bus there
Shouldn't care, I shouldn't care, bereaved as I'm feeling

Wondering what will become of me when I'm older
I'm spilling out
I'm spilling down, bad way
What will become of me when I'm older
So wise, so well
Wondering aloud, oh I need you always

What will become of me when I'm older
