Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what is right for me, yeah
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But it's plain to see that they can't comfort me

Sorry, Charlie, for the imposition
I think I've got it (got it), I got the strength to carry on, yeah
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooh, what will be

She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I
What went wrong?

Get up in the mornin', look in the mirror
I'm worn as her tooth brush hangin' in the stand, yeah
My face ain't lookin' any younger
Now I can see love's taken her toll on me

She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I
What went wrong?

Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
They can never be what she was (was) to (to) me

And she's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I
What went wrong?

She's gone
Oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone
Oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
