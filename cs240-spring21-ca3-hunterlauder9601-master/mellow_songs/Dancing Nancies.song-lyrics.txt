...when i was a boy... yeaahhh
Used to think I'm gonna be a spaceman
When i was a boy
Used to think i'm gonna be fireman
When i was a boy
Used to think i'm gonna be a farmer
When i was a boy
Used to think i might be anything that i want
When i was a boy,

When i was a boy
Everyone was so tall
When i was a boy
And fathers would live forever
When i was a boy
When i was a boy
When i was a kid
When i was a kid

When i was... well could i have been,
A parking lot attendant,
Could i have been,
A millionaire in Bel Air
Could I have been
Lost somewhere in New York City
Could i have been
Your little brother
Could i have been
Anyone other than me
Could i have been
Ohh anyone other than me
Could I have been
Anyone other than me
Could i have been... anyone

He stands, touch his hair shoes untied
Tongue gaping stare
Could I have been a magnet for money?
Could I have been anyone other than me?

Twenty three and so tired of life
Such a shame to throw it all away
The images grow darker still
Could I have been anyone other than me? And then I

I look up at the sky
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste
What's the use of worrying, what's the use of hurrying
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy

I am who I am who I am well who am I
Requesting some enlightenment
Could I have been anyone other than me?

And then I'll sing and dance I'll play for you tonight
The thrill of it all
And thrill of it all
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
But I'll work it out then I

I look up at the sky
Oh my mouth is open wide, lick and taste
What's the use of worrying, what's the use of hurrying
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy

Become dizzy, almost become dizzy

Falling out of a world of lies
Or could I have been a dancing Nancy, oooohh... yea
A dancing Nancy, yeah or I, I
I could I have been anyone,
Could I have been anyone other than me,
And then I'll sing and dance
I'll play for you tonight
The thrill of it all
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
But I work it out
Sing and dance I'll play for you tonight
The thrill of it all
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
But I work it out

I look up at the sky
Oh my mouth is open wide, lick and taste
What's the use of worrying, what's the use of hurrying
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy
Almost become dizzy
