Girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away.

Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you.

Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die.

Oh say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time
(Minute at a time)

You are...
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself.

Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again.

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die.

Oh say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time (minute at a time)
Oh, you are...
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
(Yes you are baby)
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
(More than a woman)
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
(Fades out)
