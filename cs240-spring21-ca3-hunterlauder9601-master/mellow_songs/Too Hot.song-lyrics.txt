Oh, babe
Yeah

At 17 we fell in love, high school sweethearts
Love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever for life

I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we prayed
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feeling the pain, boy, when you lose

Because, it's too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, baby (Too hot)
We gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (Too hot)
It's too hot, baby (Too hot)
We gotta cool this anger, what a mess we made
So long ago, you were my love, oh, my love
Oh, baby, too hot

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me

I remember love's fever in our hearts, boy
And in our minds
I can't imagine that this love is through
Feeling the pain, boy, when you lose

Because, it's too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, baby (Too hot)
We gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, baby (Too hot)
We gotta cool this anger, what a mess we made
So long ago, you were my love, feeling the pain
Feeling

Oh, it's hot
It's too hot
It's too hot
Can you feel it baby
Ooh, it's too, it's too

It's too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, baby
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, baby
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made

Too hot (Too hot)
Too hot, baby
Too hot
Too hot
Gotta run, too hot, baby
Oh, I just can't, I just can't take no more
No more, more

Too hot (Too hot)
Oh, baby please, oh, baby please
Won't you listen to me
Too hot
Oh, too hot baby
We gotta cool, cool
Cool
