Darling, you send me
I know you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest, you do, honest, you do
Honest, you do, whoa

You thrill me
I know you, you, you thrill me
Darling, you, you, you, you thrill me
Honest, you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But, woo, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home, woah-woah

You, you, you, you send me
I know you send me
I know you send me
Honest you do

Whoa-oh-oh, whenever I'm with you
I know, I know, I know when I'm near you
Mm-hmm, mmm-hmm, honest, you do, honest, you do
Woah-oh-oh, I know-oh-oh-oh

I know, I know, I know, when you hold me
Woah, whenever you kiss me
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But, woo, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home

I know, I know, I know you send me
I know you send me
Woah-oh, you, you, you, you send me
Honest you do
