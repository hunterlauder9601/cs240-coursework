Ooh, how do you like your love?
Ooh, how do you like your love?

But if you want to know
How I really feel
Get the cameras rolling
Get the action going
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Me and my heart you steal

More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?
More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?
More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?

Ooh, how do you like your love?
Ooh, how do you like your love?

But if you want to know
How I really feel
Just get the cameras rolling
Get the action going
Baby you know my love for you is real
So take me where you want to
Me and my heart you steal

More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?
More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?
More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like your love?

But if you want to know
How I really feel
Get the cameras rolling
Get the action going

More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?
More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?
More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?

More, more, more
How do you like it? How do you like it?
