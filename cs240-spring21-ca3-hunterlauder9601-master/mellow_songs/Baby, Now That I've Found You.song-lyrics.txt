Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I built my world around you
I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me now

Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I built my world around you
I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me no, no

Baby, baby, when first we met
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right, and I bide my time

Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you wanna leave me
But darling, I just can't let you
